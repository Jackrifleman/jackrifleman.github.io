Changes in Version 1.5.1
-------------------------------
-3 new levels (World 4 finished and first World 5 level completed)
-New aesthetic for World 4 (and possibly the rest of the game)
-Fixed an aesthetic bug where the Spies would only come out of Debug mode in red instead of blue
-Spies in debug mode now flash both red and blue
-New object: obj_bounce (its basically a trampoline!)
-Clouds in all levels with blue sky
-Darker textures in some of the levels where the top of the level is completely covered
-Minor bug fixes
-Removed some unused resources from the game's code (but can still be found in game files)

Additional Notes

-I'm currently working on a potential enemy, the Coyote Shark (you can find them in the after-game testing levels)
-Mousey Mick and Spybound are worked on in conjunction, they are the exact same game
